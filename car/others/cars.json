		"information": "The X1's turbo four-cylinder (228 horsepower, 258 pounds-feet of torque) has adequate power for just about all situations, but noticeable — and inconsistent — accelerator lag hampers things from a standstill. Still, once you get past the initial gremlins, power comes early and stays late, and the standard eight-speed automatic transmission finds the right gear without too much delay."

		"name": "Ford Escape",
		"information": "A trio of engines are available, and I found the optional turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder in my test SE model to be just right. With 231 horsepower, it's the most robust engine in the stable, providing quick, smooth takeoffs and not a hint of turbo lag. The Escape's six-speed automatic aptly delivers power on demand for strain-free highway passing and hill climbs."
